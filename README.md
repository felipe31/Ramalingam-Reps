# Ramalingam-Reps ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Felipe31/ramalingam-reps?style=plastic)

The Ramalingam and Reps' algorithm is based on Dijkstra's algorithm.
They proposed an incremental solution to the single source shortest path problem.

This project compares the behavior between the use of a binary heap and a AVL tree inside Ramalingam and Reps' algorithm.
